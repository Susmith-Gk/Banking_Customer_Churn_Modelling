# Banking_Customer_Churn_Modelling
End-to-end AI-driven customer analytics platform that combines SQL, Python, Machine Learning, and Generative AI to analyze customer behavior, predict churn, and deliver business-ready insights.

Using a real-world banking churn dataset, the project simulates how modern analytics teams combine traditional BI workflows with GenAI-powered decision support.

# Business Problem

Customer churn is a critical challenge for financial institutions, as acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones.

This project addresses the following business questions:

Which customers are most likely to churn?

What customer behaviors and attributes drive churn?

How does churn vary across regions and customer segments?

How can business users explore data using natural language instead of SQL?

# Solution Overview

The solution follows a layered analytics architecture:

  ==> Data Processing (Python): Cleaning, feature engineering, and preparation of customer data

  ==> Analytics Layer (BigQuery + SQL): Creation of reusable business metrics and churn analysis views

  ==> Machine Learning: Churn prediction model with explainability and experiment tracking

  ==> Generative AI Layer:

  Natural language → SQL querying

Automated insight generation

Model explanation for non-technical stakeholders

==> Visualization (Power BI): Interactive dashboards for churn, customer segments, and regional trends

This approach reflects how modern enterprises augment analytics with GenAI, rather than replacing existing BI systems.
